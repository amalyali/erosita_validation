# eRASS catalogue validation

The following codes in ```scripts/``` are used to generate processed versions of the original eRASS catalogues. 

The coding effort was led by Adam Malyali (MPE), but heavily relied upon the input from the eROSITA members that regularly attended the eROSITA Hackathon meetings in 2022. 
In particular, this benefitted from input from Martin Mayer (MPE) and Ang Liu (MPE), who generated the HealSparse maps that are used by the processing script to flag sources of interest.

Data and config files to be released upon eRASS1 becoming public (if I remember...), and a more detailed description of the 
flagged sources will be presented in the eRASS1 catalogue paper (Merloni et al., 2023, under review).
